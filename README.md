<h3>Consul is the one stop solution for microservices (self) registration, discovery, health checks, key-value store and load balancing.<br>
Consul is multi-data center aware by default, which means we can connect consul clusters from multiple DCs. <br>
Consul works as a cluster of client and server processes. </h3>
